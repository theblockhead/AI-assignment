PROFESSOR: So,Professor Jerison is relaxing in sunnyLondon, Ontario today and sent me in ashis substitute again. I'm glad to the hereand see you all again. So our agenda today: hesaid that he'd already talked about power seriesand Taylor's formula, I guess on last weekright, on Friday? So I'm going to go alittle further with that and show you some examples,show you some applications, and then I have thiscourse evaluation survey that I'll hand out in the last10 minutes or so of the class. I also have this handoutthat he made that says 18.01 end of term 2007. If you didn't pick this upcoming in, grab it going out. People tend not to pick itup when they walk in, I see. So grab this whenyou're going out. There's some thingsmissing from it. He has not decidedwhen his office hours will be at the end of term. He will have them, justhasn't decided when. So, check the websitefor that information. And we're looking forward tothe final exam, which is uh -- aren't we? Any questions aboutthis technical stuff? All right, let's talk aboutpower series for a little bit. So I thought I shouldreview for you what the story with power series is. OK, could I have yourattention please? So, power series is a way ofwriting a function as a sum of integral powers of x. These a_0, a_1, andso on, are numbers. An example of a powerseries is a polynomial. Not to be forgotten,one type of power series is one which goes on fora finite number of terms and then ends, so that all ofthe other, all the higher a_i's are all 0. This is a perfectly goodexample of a power series; it's a very specialkind of power series. And part of what Iwant to tell you today is that power seriesbehave, almost exactly like, polynomials. There's just onething that you have to be careful about when you'reusing power series that isn't a concern for polynomials,and I'll show you what that is in a minute. So, you should think of themas generalized polynomials. The one thing that youhave to be careful about is that there is anumber-- So one caution. There's a number which I'llcall R, where R can be between 0 and it can also be infinity. It's a number between 0and infinity, inclusive, so that when the absolutevalue of x is less than R. So when x is smaller than Rin size, the sum converges. This sum-- that sumconverges to a finite value. And when x is biggerthan R in absolute value, the sum diverges. This R is called theradius of convergence. So we'll see some examples ofwhat the radius of convergence is in various powers series aswell, and how you find it also. But, let me go on andgive you a few more of the propertiesabout power series which I think that professorJerison talked about earlier. So one of them is there'sa radius of convergence. Here's another one. If you're inside ofthe radius convergence, then the function hasall its derivatives, has all its derivatives,just like a polynomial does.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 2:\n",
      "You can differentiateit over and over again. And in terms ofthose derivatives, the number a_n inthe power series can be expressed in terms of thevalue of the derivative at 0. And this is calledTaylor's formula. So I'm saying that inside ofthis radius of convergence, the function that we'relooking at, this f(x), can be written as the value ofthe function at 0, that's a_0, plus the value ofthe derivative. This bracket n means youtake the derivative n times. So when n is 1, you takethe derivative once at 0, divided by 1!, which is!, and multiply it by x. That's the linear termin the power series. And then the quadratic term isyou take the second derivative. Remember to divideby 2!, which is 2. Multiply that byx^2 and so on out. So, in terms-- Sothe coefficients in the power series just recordthe values of the derivatives of the function at x = 0. They can be computedthat way also. Let's see. I think that's the endof my summary of things that he talked about. I think he did oneexample, and I'll repeat that example of a power series. This example wasn'tdue to David Jerison; it was due to Leonard Euler. It's the example of where thefunction is the exponential function e^x. So, let's see. Let's compute what-- I will justrepeat for you the computation of the power series fore^x, just because it's such an important thing to do. So, in order to do that, I haveto know what the derivative of e^x is, and what thesecond derivative of e^x is, and so on, because thatcomes into the Taylor formula for the coefficients. But we know what the derivativeof e^x is, it's just e^x again, and it's that wayall the way down. All the derivatives aree^x over and over again. So when I evaluate this at x =0, well, the value of e^x is 1, the value of e^x is 1 at x = 0. You get a value of1 all the way down. So all these derivativesat 0 have the value 1. And now, when I pluginto this formula, I find e^x is 1 plus 1*xplus 1/2! x^2 plus 1/3! x^3, plus and so on. So all of thesenumbers are 1, and all you wind up with is thefactorials in the denominators. That's the power series for e^x. This was a discovery of LeonhardEuler in 1740 or something. Yes, Ma'am. AUDIENCE: When you'rewriting out the power series, how far do you haveto write it out? PROFESSOR: How far do youhave to write the power series before it becomes well defined? Before it's a satisfactorysolution to an exam problem, I suppose, is another wayto phrase the question. Until you can seewhat the pattern is. I can see what the pattern is. Is there anyone who'sin doubt about what the next term might be? Some people wouldtell you that you have to write thesummation convention thing. Don't believe them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 3:\n",
      "If you right out enoughterms to make it clear, that's good enough. OK? Is that an answer for you? AUDIENCE: Yes, Thank you. PROFESSOR: OK, sothat's a basic example. Let's do another basicexample of a power series. Oh yes, and by the way, wheneveryou write out a power series, you should say what theradius of convergence is. And for now, I willjust to tell you that the radius of convergenceof this power series is infinity; thatis, this sum always converges for any value of x. I'll say a little moreabout that in a few minutes. Yeah? AUDIENCE: So which functionscan be written as power series? PROFESSOR: Which functions canbe written as power series? That's an excellent question. Any function that hasa reasonable expression can be written asa power series. I'm not giving you a very goodanswer because the true answer is a little bit complicated. But any of thefunctions that occur in calculus like sines,cosines, tangents, they all have power series expansions, OK? We'll see more examples. Let's do another example. Here's another example. I guess this was example one. So, this example, I think,was due to Newton, not Euler. Let's find the power seriesexpansion of this function: 1/(1+x). Well, I think thatsomewhere along the line, you learned about the geometricseries which tells you that-- which tells youwhat the answer to this is, and I'll just write it out. The geometric series tellsyou that this function can be written as analternating sum of powers of x. You may wonder wherethese minuses came from. Well, if you really thinkabout the geometric series, as you probably remembered,there was a minus sign here, and that gets replacedby these minus signs. I think maybe Jerisontalked about this also. Anyway, here'sanother basic example. Remember what thegraph of this function looks like when x = -1. Then there's alittle problem here because thedenominator becomes 0, so the graph has a pole there. It goes up toinfinity at x = -1, and that's an indication thatthe radius of convergence is not infinity. Because if you try to convergeto this infinite number by putting in x = -1, here,you'll have a big problem. In fact, you see whenyou put in x = -1, you keep getting1 in every term, and it gets bigger andbigger and does not converge. In this example, theradius of convergence is 1. OK, so, let's doa new example now. Oh, and by the way,I should say you can calculate these numbersusing Taylor's formula. If you haven't seenit, check it out. Calculate the iteratedderivatives of this function and plug in x = 0 and seethat you get +1, -1, +1, -1, and so on. Yes sir. AUDIENCE: For theradius of convergence I see that if you do-1 it'll blow out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 4:\n",
      "If you put in 1 though, itseems like it would be fine. PROFESSOR: Thequestions is I can see that there's aproblem at x = -1, why is there alsoa problem at x = 1 where the graph isperfectly smooth and innocuous and finite. That's anotherexcellent question. The problem is that if yougo off to a radius of 1 in any direction and there'sa problem, that's it. That's what the radiusof convergence is. Here, what does happenif I put an x = +1? So, let's look atthe partial sums. Do x = +1 in your mind here. So I'll get a partial sum 1,then 0, and then 1, and then 0, and then 1. So even though it doesn'tgo up to infinity, it still does not converge. AUDIENCE: Andanything in between? PROFESSOR: Any ofthese other things will also fail toconverge in this example. Well, that's the only tworeal numbers at the edge. Right? OK, let's do adifferent example now. How about a trig function? The sine of x. I'm going to compute the powerseries expansion for sin(x). and I'm going to do itusing Taylor's formula. So Taylor's formulasays that I have to start computingderivatives of sin(x). Sounds like it's goingto be a lot of work. Let's see, the derivativeof the sine is the cosine. And the derivativeof the cosine, that's the second derivativeof the sine, is what? Remember the minus,it's -sin(x). OK, now I want to take the thirdderivative of the sine, which is the derivativeof sine prime prime, so it's the derivative of this. And we just decidedthe derivative of sine is cosine, so Iget cosine, but I have this minus sign in front. And now I want todifferentiate again, so the cosinebecomes a minus sine, and that sign cancels with thisminus sign to give me sin(x). You follow that? It's a lot of -1'scanceling out there. So, all of a sudden, I'mright back where I started; these two are the same and thepattern will now repeat forever and ever. Higher and higherderivatives of sines are just plus or minussines and cosines. Now Taylor's formula says Ishould now substitute x = 0 into this and see whathappens, so let's do that. When x is equals to 0, thesine is 0 and the cosine is 1. The sine is 0, sominus 0 is also 0. The cosine is 1, butnow there's a minus one, and now I'm backwhere I started, and so the pattern will repeat. OK, so the valuesof the derivatives are all zeros andplus and minus ones and they go through thatpattern, four-fold periodicity, over and over again. And so we can writeout what sin(x) is using Taylor's formula,using this formula. So I put in the valueat 0 which is 0, then I put in the derivativewhich is 1, multiplied by x. Then, I have the secondderivative divided by 2!, but the secondderivative at 0 is 0. So I'm going todrop that term out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 5:\n",
      "Now I have the thirdderivative which is -1. And remember the 3! in the denominator. That's the coefficient of x^3. What's the fourth derivative? Well, here we are, it'son the board, it's 0. So I drop that term outgo up to the fifth term, the fifth power of x. Its derivative is now 1. We've gone through the pattern,we're back at +1 as the value of the iterated derivative,so now I get 1/5! x^5. Now, you tell me, have wedone enough terms to see what the pattern is? I guess the nextterm will be a -1/7! x^7, and so on. Let me write this outagain just so we have it. x^3 / 3!-- So it'sx minus x^3 / 3! plus x^5 / 5!. You guessed it, and so on. That's the powerseries expansion for the sine of x, OK? And so, the sign alternate,and these denominators get very big, don't they? Exponentials grow very fast. Let me make a remark. R is infinity here. The radius of convergenceof this power series again is infinity, andlet me just say why. The reason is that the generalterm is going to be like x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!. An odd number I canwrite as 2n + 1. And what I want tosay is that the size of this, what happensto the size of this as n goes to infinity? So let's just think about this. For a fixed x, let'sfix the number x. Look at powers of x andthink about the size of this expression whenn gets to be large. So let's just dothat for a second. So, x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!, Ican write out like this. It's x / 1 times x / 2-- sorry -- times x / 3, times x / (2n+1). I've multiplied x by itself2n+1 times in the numerator, and I've multipliedthe numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, by each otherin the denominator, and that gives me the factorial. So I've just writtenthis out like this. Now x is fixed, so maybeit's a million, OK? It's big, but fixed. What happens to these numbers? Well at first,they're pretty big. This is 1,000,000 / 2,this is 1,000,000 / 3. But when n gets to be--Maybe if n is 1,000,000, then this is about 1/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 6:\n",
      "If n is a billion, then thisis about 1/2,000, right? The denominators keepgetting bigger and bigger, but the numerators staythe same; they're always x. So when I take the product,if I go far enough out, I'm going to be multiplying,by very, very small numbers and more and more of them. And so no matter whatx is, these numbers will converge to 0. They'll get smaller andsmaller as x gets to be bigger. That's the sign that x is insideof the radius of convergence. This is the sign foryou that this series converges for that value of x. And because I could dothis for any x, this works. This convergence to0 for any fixed x. That's what tellsyou that you can take-- that the radius ofconvergence is infinity. Because in theformula, in the fact, in this property thatthe radius of convergence talks about, if R isequal to infinity, this is no condition on x. Every number is less thaninfinity in absolute value. So if this convergenceto 0 of the general term works for every x, then radiusof convergence is infinity. Well that was kindof fast, but I think that you've heardsomething about that earlier as well. Anyway, so we've got thesine function, a new function with its own power series. It's a way of computing sin(x). If you take enoughterms you'll get a good evaluation of sin(x). for any x. This tells you a lotabout the function sin(x) but not everything at all. For example, fromthis formula, it's very hard to see that thesine of x is periodic. It's not obvious at all. Somewhere hidden awayin this expression is the number pi, thehalf of the period. But that's not clear fromthe power series at all. So the power series arevery good for some things, but they hide otherproperties of functions. Well, so I want to spenda few minutes telling you about what you can dowith a power series, once you have one, to get newpower series, so new power series from old. And this is also calledoperations on power series. So what are the things thatwe can do to a power series? Well one of the thingsyou can do is multiply. So, for example, what ifI want to compute a power series for x sin(x)? Well I have a power seriesfor sin(x), I just did it. How about a power series for x? Actually, I did that here too. The function x is avery simple polynomial. It's a polynomial wherethat's 0, a_1 is 1, and all the othercoefficients are 0. So x itself is a powerseries, a very simple one. sin(x) is a powers series. And what I want toencourage you to do is treat power seriesjust like polynomials and multiply them together. We'll see other operations too. So, to compute the power seriesfor x sin(x), of I just take this one and multiply it by x. So let's see if Ican do that right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 7:\n",
      "It distributes through:x^2 minus x^4 / 3! plus x^6 / 5!, and so on. And again, theradius of convergence is going to be the smaller ofthe two radii of convergence here. So it's R equalsinfinity in this case. OK, you can multiplypower series together. It can be a pain if thepower series are very long, but if one of them isx, it's pretty simple. OK, that's one thing I can do. Notice something by the way. You know that evenand odd functions? So, sine is an odd function,x is an odd function, the product of two oddfunctions is an even function. And that's reflected in the factthat all the powers that occur in the power series are even. For an odd function, like thesine, all the powers that occur are odd powers of x. That's always true. OK, we can multiply. I can also differentiate. So let's just do acase of that, and use the process ofdifferentiation to find out what the powerseries for cos(x) is by writing the cos(x) asthe derivative of the sine and differentiatingterm by term. So, I'll take thisexpression for the power series of the sine anddifferentiate it term by term, and I'll get the powerseries for cosine. So, let's see. The derivative of x is one. Now, the derivative of x^3 is3x^2, and then there's a 3! in the denominator. And the derivative of x^55x^4, and there's a 5! in the denominator,and so on and so on. And now somecancellation happens. So this is 1 minus, well, the3 cancels with the last factor in this 3 factorialand leaves you with 2!. And the 5 cancels with thelast factor in the 5 factorial and leaves you with a 4! in the denominator. And so there you go, there'sthe power series expansion for the cosine. It's got all even powers of x. They alternate, and you havefactorials in the denominator. And of course, you couldderive that expression by using Taylor's formula, bythe same kind of calculation you did here, taking higherand higher derivatives of the cosine. You get the sameperiodic pattern of derivatives and valuesof derivatives at x = 0. But here's a cleaner way todo it, simpler way to do it, because we already knewthe derivative of the sine. When you differentiate, you keepthe same radius of convergence. OK, so we canmultiply, I can add too and multiply by aconstant, things like that. How about integrating? That's what half of thiscourse was about isn't it? So, let's integrate something. So, the integration I'mgoing to do is this one: the integral from 0to x of dt / (1+x). What is that integralas a function?\n",

      "Paragraph 8:\n",
      "So, when I find theanti-derivative of this, I get ln(1+t), and then whenI evaluate that at t = x, I get ln(1+x). And when I evaluate the naturallog at 0, I get the ln 1, which is 0, so thisis what you get, OK? This is really valid, by theway, for x bigger than -1. But you don't want to thinkabout this quite like this when x is smaller than that. Now, I'm going to try to applypower series methods here and find-- use this integralto find a power series for the natural log, and I'lldo it by plugging into this expression what the powerseries for 1/(1+t) was. And I know what that is becauseI wrote it down on the board up here. Change the variablefrom x to t there, and so 1/(1+t) is 1 minus tplus t^2 minus t^3, and so on. So that's the thing in theinside of the integral, and now it's legal tointegrate that term by term, so let's do that. I'm going to get somethingwhich I will then evaluate at x and at 0. So, when I integrate 1 I getx, and when I integrate t, I get t. I'm sorry. When I integrate t, I get t^2/ 2, and t^2 gives me t^3 / 3, and so on and so on. And then, when Iput in t = x, well, I just replace all the t's byx's, and when I put in t = 0, I get 0. So this equals x. So, I've discovered that ln(1+x)is x minus x^2 / 2 plus x^3 / 3 minus x^4 / 4, andso on and so on. There's the power seriesexpansion for ln(1+x). And because I beganwith a power series whose radius ofconvergence was just 1, I began with this powerseries, the radius of convergence of thisis also going to be 1. Also, because this function,as I just pointed out, this function goes bad whenx becomes less than -1, so some problem happens,and that's reflected in the radius of convergence. Cool. So, you can integrate. That is the correct power seriesexpansion for the ln(1+x), and another victory of Euler'swas to use this kind of power series expansion to calculatenatural logarithms in a much more efficient way thanpeople had done before. OK, one more property, I think. What are we at here, 3? 4. Substitute. Very appropriate for meas a substitute teacher to tell you about substitution. So I'm going to try to findthe power series expansion of e^(-t^2). OK? And the way I'll do that isby taking the power series expansion for e^x,which we have up there, and make the substitution x =-t^2 in the expansion for e^x. Did you have a question? AUDIENCE: Well,it's just concerning the radius of convergence. You can't define x so that isalways positive, and if so, it wouldn't have a radiusof convergence, right? PROFESSOR: Like I say, again theworry is this ln(1+x) function is perfectly wellbehaved for large x. Why does the power seriesfail to converge for large x? Well suppose thatx is bigger than 1, then here you getbigger and bigger powers of x, which willgrow to infinity, and they grow large fasterthan the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They grow exponentially, andthese just grow linearly. So, again, the general term,when x is bigger than one, the general term willgo off to infinity, even though the functionthat you're talking about, log of net of 1 plusx is perfectly good. So the power series is notgood outside of the radius of convergence. It's just a fact of life. Yes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Paragraph 9:\n",
      "AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: I'd rather--talk to me after class. The question is why isit the smaller of the two radii of convergence? The basic answeris, well, you can't expect it to be bigger than thatsmaller one, because the power series only givesyou information inside of that rangeabout the function, so. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Well, in thiscase, both of the radii of convergence are infinity. x has radius of convergenceinfinity for sure, and sin(x) does too. So you get infinityin that case, OK? OK, let's just dothis, and then I'm going to integratethis and that'll be the end of what Ihave time for today. So what's the powerseries expansion for this? The power seriesexpansion of this is going to be afunction of t, right, because the variable here is t. I get it by taking my expansionfor e^x and putting in what x is in terms of t. Whoops! And so on and so on. I just put in -t^2 in place ofx there in the series expansion for e^x. I can work this outa little bit better. -t^2 is what it is. This is going to give me a t^4and the minus squared is going to give me a plus,so I get t^4 / 2!. Then I get (-t)^3, so there'llbe a minus sign and a t^6 and the denominator 3!. So the signs aregoing to alternate, the powers are all even,and the denominators are these factorials. Several times as thiscourse has gone on, the error function hasmade an appearance. The error function was, I guessit gets normalized by putting a 2 over the squareroot of pi in front, and it's the integral ofe^(-t^2) dt from 0 to x. And this normalizationis here because as x gets to be largethe value becomes 1. So this error function isvery important in the theory of probability. And I think you calculatedthis fact at some point in the course. So the standard definition ofthe error function, you put a 2 over the squareroot of pi in front. Let's calculate itspower series expansion. So there's a 2 overthe square root of pi that hurts nobodyhere in the front. And now I want tointegrate e^(-t^2), and I'm going to use thispower series expansion for that to see what you get. So I'm just going towrite this out I think. I did it out carefully inanother example over there, so I'll do it alittle quicker now. Integrate this termby term, you're just integrating powers oft so it's pretty simple, so I get-- and then I'mevaluating at x and then at 0. So I get x minus x^3 /3, plus x^5 / (5*2!), 5 from integratingthe t^4, and the 2! from this denominatorthat we already had. And then there's a -x^7/ (7*3!), and plus, and so on, and you can imaginehow they go on from there. I guess to get thisexactly in the form that we began talking about,I should multiply through. So the coefficient of x is 2over the square root of pi, and the coefficient of x^3 is-2 over 3 times the square root of pi, and so on. But this is a perfectly goodway to write this power series expansion as well. And, this is a very good way tocompute the value of the error function. It's a new functionin our experience. Your calculatorprobably calculates it, and your calculator probablydoes it by this method. OK, so that's my sermonon examples of things you can do with power series.\n",

PROFESSOR: So,Professor Jerison is relaxing in sunnyLondon, Ontario today and sent me in ashis substitute again. I'm glad to the hereand see you all again. So our agenda today: hesaid that he'd already talked about power seriesand Taylor's formula, I guess on last weekright, on Friday? So I'm going to go alittle further with that and show you some examples,show you some applications, and then I have thiscourse evaluation survey that I'll hand out in the last10 minutes or so of the class. I also have this handoutthat he made that says 18.01 end of term 2007. If you didn't pick this upcoming in, grab it going out. People tend not to pick itup when they walk in, I see. So grab this whenyou're going out. There's some thingsmissing from it. He has not decidedwhen his office hours will be at the end of term. He will have them, justhasn't decided when. So, check the websitefor that information. And we're looking forward tothe final exam, which is uh -- aren't we? Any questions aboutthis technical stuff? All right, let's talk aboutpower series for a little bit. So I thought I shouldreview for you what the story with power series is. OK, could I have yourattention please? So, power series is a way ofwriting a function as a sum of integral powers of x. These a_0, a_1, andso on, are numbers. An example of a powerseries is a polynomial. Not to be forgotten,one type of power series is one which goes on fora finite number of terms and then ends, so that all ofthe other, all the higher a_i's are all 0. This is a perfectly goodexample of a power series; it's a very specialkind of power series. And part of what Iwant to tell you today is that power seriesbehave, almost exactly like, polynomials. There's just onething that you have to be careful about when you'reusing power series that isn't a concern for polynomials,and I'll show you what that is in a minute. So, you should think of themas generalized polynomials. The one thing that youhave to be careful about is that there is anumber-- So one caution. There's a number which I'llcall R, where R can be between 0 and it can also be infinity. It's a number between 0and infinity, inclusive, so that when the absolutevalue of x is less than R. So when x is smaller than Rin size, the sum converges. This sum-- that sumconverges to a finite value. And when x is biggerthan R in absolute value, the sum diverges. This R is called theradius of convergence. So we'll see some examples ofwhat the radius of convergence is in various powers series aswell, and how you find it also. But, let me go on andgive you a few more of the propertiesabout power series which I think that professorJerison talked about earlier. So one of them is there'sa radius of convergence. Here's another one. If you're inside ofthe radius convergence, then the function hasall its derivatives, has all its derivatives,just like a polynomial does. You can differentiateit over and over again. And in terms ofthose derivatives, the number a_n inthe power series can be expressed in terms of thevalue of the derivative at 0. And this is calledTaylor's formula. So I'm saying that inside ofthis radius of convergence, the function that we'relooking at, this f(x), can be written as the value ofthe function at 0, that's a_0, plus the value ofthe derivative. This bracket n means youtake the derivative n times. So when n is 1, you takethe derivative once at 0, divided by 1!, which is!, and multiply it by x. That's the linear termin the power series. And then the quadratic term isyou take the second derivative. Remember to divideby 2!, which is 2. Multiply that byx^2 and so on out. So, in terms-- Sothe coefficients in the power series just recordthe values of the derivatives of the function at x = 0. They can be computedthat way also. Let's see. I think that's the endof my summary of things that he talked about. I think he did oneexample, and I'll repeat that example of a power series. This example wasn'tdue to David Jerison; it was due to Leonard Euler. It's the example of where thefunction is the exponential function e^x. So, let's see. Let's compute what-- I will justrepeat for you the computation of the power series fore^x, just because it's such an important thing to do. So, in order to do that, I haveto know what the derivative of e^x is, and what thesecond derivative of e^x is, and so on, because thatcomes into the Taylor formula for the coefficients. But we know what the derivativeof e^x is, it's just e^x again, and it's that wayall the way down. All the derivatives aree^x over and over again. So when I evaluate this at x =0, well, the value of e^x is 1, the value of e^x is 1 at x = 0. You get a value of1 all the way down. So all these derivativesat 0 have the value 1. And now, when I pluginto this formula, I find e^x is 1 plus 1*xplus 1/2! x^2 plus 1/3! x^3, plus and so on. So all of thesenumbers are 1, and all you wind up with is thefactorials in the denominators. That's the power series for e^x. This was a discovery of LeonhardEuler in 1740 or something. Yes, Ma'am. AUDIENCE: When you'rewriting out the power series, how far do you haveto write it out? PROFESSOR: How far do youhave to write the power series before it becomes well defined? Before it's a satisfactorysolution to an exam problem, I suppose, is another wayto phrase the question. Until you can seewhat the pattern is. I can see what the pattern is. Is there anyone who'sin doubt about what the next term might be? Some people wouldtell you that you have to write thesummation convention thing. Don't believe them. If you right out enoughterms to make it clear, that's good enough. OK? Is that an answer for you? AUDIENCE: Yes, Thank you. PROFESSOR: OK, sothat's a basic example. Let's do another basicexample of a power series. Oh yes, and by the way, wheneveryou write out a power series, you should say what theradius of convergence is. And for now, I willjust to tell you that the radius of convergenceof this power series is infinity; thatis, this sum always converges for any value of x. I'll say a little moreabout that in a few minutes. Yeah? AUDIENCE: So which functionscan be written as power series? PROFESSOR: Which functions canbe written as power series? That's an excellent question. Any function that hasa reasonable expression can be written asa power series. I'm not giving you a very goodanswer because the true answer is a little bit complicated. But any of thefunctions that occur in calculus like sines,cosines, tangents, they all have power series expansions, OK? We'll see more examples. Let's do another example. Here's another example. I guess this was example one. So, this example, I think,was due to Newton, not Euler. Let's find the power seriesexpansion of this function: 1/(1+x). Well, I think thatsomewhere along the line, you learned about the geometricseries which tells you that-- which tells youwhat the answer to this is, and I'll just write it out. The geometric series tellsyou that this function can be written as analternating sum of powers of x. You may wonder wherethese minuses came from. Well, if you really thinkabout the geometric series, as you probably remembered,there was a minus sign here, and that gets replacedby these minus signs. I think maybe Jerisontalked about this also. Anyway, here'sanother basic example. Remember what thegraph of this function looks like when x = -1. Then there's alittle problem here because thedenominator becomes 0, so the graph has a pole there. It goes up toinfinity at x = -1, and that's an indication thatthe radius of convergence is not infinity. Because if you try to convergeto this infinite number by putting in x = -1, here,you'll have a big problem. In fact, you see whenyou put in x = -1, you keep getting1 in every term, and it gets bigger andbigger and does not converge. In this example, theradius of convergence is 1. OK, so, let's doa new example now. Oh, and by the way,I should say you can calculate these numbersusing Taylor's formula. If you haven't seenit, check it out. Calculate the iteratedderivatives of this function and plug in x = 0 and seethat you get +1, -1, +1, -1, and so on. Yes sir. AUDIENCE: For theradius of convergence I see that if you do-1 it'll blow out. If you put in 1 though, itseems like it would be fine. PROFESSOR: Thequestions is I can see that there's aproblem at x = -1, why is there alsoa problem at x = 1 where the graph isperfectly smooth and innocuous and finite. That's anotherexcellent question. The problem is that if yougo off to a radius of 1 in any direction and there'sa problem, that's it. That's what the radiusof convergence is. Here, what does happenif I put an x = +1? So, let's look atthe partial sums. Do x = +1 in your mind here. So I'll get a partial sum 1,then 0, and then 1, and then 0, and then 1. So even though it doesn'tgo up to infinity, it still does not converge. AUDIENCE: Andanything in between? PROFESSOR: Any ofthese other things will also fail toconverge in this example. Well, that's the only tworeal numbers at the edge. Right? OK, let's do adifferent example now. How about a trig function? The sine of x. I'm going to compute the powerseries expansion for sin(x). and I'm going to do itusing Taylor's formula. So Taylor's formulasays that I have to start computingderivatives of sin(x). Sounds like it's goingto be a lot of work. Let's see, the derivativeof the sine is the cosine. And the derivativeof the cosine, that's the second derivativeof the sine, is what? Remember the minus,it's -sin(x). OK, now I want to take the thirdderivative of the sine, which is the derivativeof sine prime prime, so it's the derivative of this. And we just decidedthe derivative of sine is cosine, so Iget cosine, but I have this minus sign in front. And now I want todifferentiate again, so the cosinebecomes a minus sine, and that sign cancels with thisminus sign to give me sin(x). You follow that? It's a lot of -1'scanceling out there. So, all of a sudden, I'mright back where I started; these two are the same and thepattern will now repeat forever and ever. Higher and higherderivatives of sines are just plus or minussines and cosines. Now Taylor's formula says Ishould now substitute x = 0 into this and see whathappens, so let's do that. When x is equals to 0, thesine is 0 and the cosine is 1. The sine is 0, sominus 0 is also 0. The cosine is 1, butnow there's a minus one, and now I'm backwhere I started, and so the pattern will repeat. OK, so the valuesof the derivatives are all zeros andplus and minus ones and they go through thatpattern, four-fold periodicity, over and over again. And so we can writeout what sin(x) is using Taylor's formula,using this formula. So I put in the valueat 0 which is 0, then I put in the derivativewhich is 1, multiplied by x. Then, I have the secondderivative divided by 2!, but the secondderivative at 0 is 0. So I'm going todrop that term out. Now I have the thirdderivative which is -1. And remember the 3! in the denominator. That's the coefficient of x^3. What's the fourth derivative? Well, here we are, it'son the board, it's 0. So I drop that term outgo up to the fifth term, the fifth power of x. Its derivative is now 1. We've gone through the pattern,we're back at +1 as the value of the iterated derivative,so now I get 1/5! x^5. Now, you tell me, have wedone enough terms to see what the pattern is? I guess the nextterm will be a -1/7! x^7, and so on. Let me write this outagain just so we have it. x^3 / 3!-- So it'sx minus x^3 / 3! plus x^5 / 5!. You guessed it, and so on. That's the powerseries expansion for the sine of x, OK? And so, the sign alternate,and these denominators get very big, don't they? Exponentials grow very fast. Let me make a remark. R is infinity here. The radius of convergenceof this power series again is infinity, andlet me just say why. The reason is that the generalterm is going to be like x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!. An odd number I canwrite as 2n + 1. And what I want tosay is that the size of this, what happensto the size of this as n goes to infinity? So let's just think about this. For a fixed x, let'sfix the number x. Look at powers of x andthink about the size of this expression whenn gets to be large. So let's just dothat for a second. So, x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!, Ican write out like this. It's x / 1 times x / 2-- sorry -- times x / 3, times x / (2n+1). I've multiplied x by itself2n+1 times in the numerator, and I've multipliedthe numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, by each otherin the denominator, and that gives me the factorial. So I've just writtenthis out like this. Now x is fixed, so maybeit's a million, OK? It's big, but fixed. What happens to these numbers? Well at first,they're pretty big. This is 1,000,000 / 2,this is 1,000,000 / 3. But when n gets to be--Maybe if n is 1,000,000, then this is about 1/2. If n is a billion, then thisis about 1/2,000, right? The denominators keepgetting bigger and bigger, but the numerators staythe same; they're always x. So when I take the product,if I go far enough out, I'm going to be multiplying,by very, very small numbers and more and more of them. And so no matter whatx is, these numbers will converge to 0. They'll get smaller andsmaller as x gets to be bigger. That's the sign that x is insideof the radius of convergence. This is the sign foryou that this series converges for that value of x. And because I could dothis for any x, this works. This convergence to0 for any fixed x. That's what tellsyou that you can take-- that the radius ofconvergence is infinity. Because in theformula, in the fact, in this property thatthe radius of convergence talks about, if R isequal to infinity, this is no condition on x. Every number is less thaninfinity in absolute value. So if this convergenceto 0 of the general term works for every x, then radiusof convergence is infinity. Well that was kindof fast, but I think that you've heardsomething about that earlier as well. Anyway, so we've got thesine function, a new function with its own power series. It's a way of computing sin(x). If you take enoughterms you'll get a good evaluation of sin(x). for any x. This tells you a lotabout the function sin(x) but not everything at all. For example, fromthis formula, it's very hard to see that thesine of x is periodic. It's not obvious at all. Somewhere hidden awayin this expression is the number pi, thehalf of the period. But that's not clear fromthe power series at all. So the power series arevery good for some things, but they hide otherproperties of functions. Well, so I want to spenda few minutes telling you about what you can dowith a power series, once you have one, to get newpower series, so new power series from old. And this is also calledoperations on power series. So what are the things thatwe can do to a power series? Well one of the thingsyou can do is multiply. So, for example, what ifI want to compute a power series for x sin(x)? Well I have a power seriesfor sin(x), I just did it. How about a power series for x? Actually, I did that here too. The function x is avery simple polynomial. It's a polynomial wherethat's 0, a_1 is 1, and all the othercoefficients are 0. So x itself is a powerseries, a very simple one. sin(x) is a powers series. And what I want toencourage you to do is treat power seriesjust like polynomials and multiply them together. We'll see other operations too. So, to compute the power seriesfor x sin(x), of I just take this one and multiply it by x. So let's see if Ican do that right. It distributes through:x^2 minus x^4 / 3! plus x^6 / 5!, and so on. And again, theradius of convergence is going to be the smaller ofthe two radii of convergence here. So it's R equalsinfinity in this case. OK, you can multiplypower series together. It can be a pain if thepower series are very long, but if one of them isx, it's pretty simple. OK, that's one thing I can do. Notice something by the way. You know that evenand odd functions? So, sine is an odd function,x is an odd function, the product of two oddfunctions is an even function. And that's reflected in the factthat all the powers that occur in the power series are even. For an odd function, like thesine, all the powers that occur are odd powers of x. That's always true. OK, we can multiply. I can also differentiate. So let's just do acase of that, and use the process ofdifferentiation to find out what the powerseries for cos(x) is by writing the cos(x) asthe derivative of the sine and differentiatingterm by term. So, I'll take thisexpression for the power series of the sine anddifferentiate it term by term, and I'll get the powerseries for cosine. So, let's see. The derivative of x is one. Now, the derivative of x^3 is3x^2, and then there's a 3! in the denominator. And the derivative of x^55x^4, and there's a 5! in the denominator,and so on and so on. And now somecancellation happens. So this is 1 minus, well, the3 cancels with the last factor in this 3 factorialand leaves you with 2!. And the 5 cancels with thelast factor in the 5 factorial and leaves you with a 4! in the denominator. And so there you go, there'sthe power series expansion for the cosine. It's got all even powers of x. They alternate, and you havefactorials in the denominator. And of course, you couldderive that expression by using Taylor's formula, bythe same kind of calculation you did here, taking higherand higher derivatives of the cosine. You get the sameperiodic pattern of derivatives and valuesof derivatives at x = 0. But here's a cleaner way todo it, simpler way to do it, because we already knewthe derivative of the sine. When you differentiate, you keepthe same radius of convergence. OK, so we canmultiply, I can add too and multiply by aconstant, things like that. How about integrating? That's what half of thiscourse was about isn't it? So, let's integrate something. So, the integration I'mgoing to do is this one: the integral from 0to x of dt / (1+x). What is that integralas a function? So, when I find theanti-derivative of this, I get ln(1+t), and then whenI evaluate that at t = x, I get ln(1+x). And when I evaluate the naturallog at 0, I get the ln 1, which is 0, so thisis what you get, OK? This is really valid, by theway, for x bigger than -1. But you don't want to thinkabout this quite like this when x is smaller than that. Now, I'm going to try to applypower series methods here and find-- use this integralto find a power series for the natural log, and I'lldo it by plugging into this expression what the powerseries for 1/(1+t) was. And I know what that is becauseI wrote it down on the board up here. Change the variablefrom x to t there, and so 1/(1+t) is 1 minus tplus t^2 minus t^3, and so on. So that's the thing in theinside of the integral, and now it's legal tointegrate that term by term, so let's do that. I'm going to get somethingwhich I will then evaluate at x and at 0. So, when I integrate 1 I getx, and when I integrate t, I get t. I'm sorry. When I integrate t, I get t^2/ 2, and t^2 gives me t^3 / 3, and so on and so on. And then, when Iput in t = x, well, I just replace all the t's byx's, and when I put in t = 0, I get 0. So this equals x. So, I've discovered that ln(1+x)is x minus x^2 / 2 plus x^3 / 3 minus x^4 / 4, andso on and so on. There's the power seriesexpansion for ln(1+x). And because I beganwith a power series whose radius ofconvergence was just 1, I began with this powerseries, the radius of convergence of thisis also going to be 1. Also, because this function,as I just pointed out, this function goes bad whenx becomes less than -1, so some problem happens,and that's reflected in the radius of convergence. Cool. So, you can integrate. That is the correct power seriesexpansion for the ln(1+x), and another victory of Euler'swas to use this kind of power series expansion to calculatenatural logarithms in a much more efficient way thanpeople had done before. OK, one more property, I think. What are we at here, 3? 4. Substitute. Very appropriate for meas a substitute teacher to tell you about substitution. So I'm going to try to findthe power series expansion of e^(-t^2). OK? And the way I'll do that isby taking the power series expansion for e^x,which we have up there, and make the substitution x =-t^2 in the expansion for e^x. Did you have a question? AUDIENCE: Well,it's just concerning the radius of convergence. You can't define x so that isalways positive, and if so, it wouldn't have a radiusof convergence, right? PROFESSOR: Like I say, again theworry is this ln(1+x) function is perfectly wellbehaved for large x. Why does the power seriesfail to converge for large x? Well suppose thatx is bigger than 1, then here you getbigger and bigger powers of x, which willgrow to infinity, and they grow large fasterthan the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They grow exponentially, andthese just grow linearly. So, again, the general term,when x is bigger than one, the general term willgo off to infinity, even though the functionthat you're talking about, log of net of 1 plusx is perfectly good. So the power series is notgood outside of the radius of convergence. It's just a fact of life. Yes? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: I'd rather--talk to me after class. The question is why isit the smaller of the two radii of convergence? The basic answeris, well, you can't expect it to be bigger than thatsmaller one, because the power series only givesyou information inside of that rangeabout the function, so. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Well, in thiscase, both of the radii of convergence are infinity. x has radius of convergenceinfinity for sure, and sin(x) does too. So you get infinityin that case, OK? OK, let's just dothis, and then I'm going to integratethis and that'll be the end of what Ihave time for today. So what's the powerseries expansion for this? The power seriesexpansion of this is going to be afunction of t, right, because the variable here is t. I get it by taking my expansionfor e^x and putting in what x is in terms of t. Whoops! And so on and so on. I just put in -t^2 in place ofx there in the series expansion for e^x. I can work this outa little bit better. -t^2 is what it is. This is going to give me a t^4and the minus squared is going to give me a plus,so I get t^4 / 2!. Then I get (-t)^3, so there'llbe a minus sign and a t^6 and the denominator 3!. So the signs aregoing to alternate, the powers are all even,and the denominators are these factorials. Several times as thiscourse has gone on, the error function hasmade an appearance. The error function was, I guessit gets normalized by putting a 2 over the squareroot of pi in front, and it's the integral ofe^(-t^2) dt from 0 to x. And this normalizationis here because as x gets to be largethe value becomes 1. So this error function isvery important in the theory of probability. And I think you calculatedthis fact at some point in the course. So the standard definition ofthe error function, you put a 2 over the squareroot of pi in front. Let's calculate itspower series expansion. So there's a 2 overthe square root of pi that hurts nobodyhere in the front. And now I want tointegrate e^(-t^2), and I'm going to use thispower series expansion for that to see what you get. So I'm just going towrite this out I think. I did it out carefully inanother example over there, so I'll do it alittle quicker now. Integrate this termby term, you're just integrating powers oft so it's pretty simple, so I get-- and then I'mevaluating at x and then at 0. So I get x minus x^3 /3, plus x^5 / (5*2!), 5 from integratingthe t^4, and the 2! from this denominatorthat we already had. And then there's a -x^7/ (7*3!), and plus, and so on, and you can imaginehow they go on from there. I guess to get thisexactly in the form that we began talking about,I should multiply through. So the coefficient of x is 2over the square root of pi, and the coefficient of x^3 is-2 over 3 times the square root of pi, and so on. But this is a perfectly goodway to write this power series expansion as well. And, this is a very good way tocompute the value of the error function. It's a new functionin our experience. Your calculatorprobably calculates it, and your calculator probablydoes it by this method. OK, so that's my sermonon examples of things you can do with power series. So, we're going to do theCEG thing in just a minute. Professor Jerison wantedme to make an ad for 18.02. Just in case you were thinkingof not taking it next term, you really should take it. It will put a lot ofthings in this course into context, for one thing. It's about vectorcalculus and so on. So you'll learn aboutvectors and things like that. But it comes back andexplains some things in this course that mighthave been a little bit strange, like these strangeformulas for the product rule and the quotient rule andthe sort of random formulas. Well, one of the thingsyou learn in 18.02 is that they're all specialcases of the chain rule. And just to drivethat point home, he wanted me to show youthis poem of his that really drives the pointshome forcefully, I think.\n",
